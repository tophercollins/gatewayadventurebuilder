### Data Inventory

|-----------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| Audio recordings | Local device only | Nowhere (macOS Whisper) or Google Gemini (Win/Linux transcription) | User records and deletes manually |
| Transcripts (raw) | Local SQLite DB | Google Gemini (for AI processing) | Immutable after creation; can delete session |
| Transcripts (edited) | Local SQLite DB | Nowhere | User edits freely |
| AI-generated summaries | Local SQLite DB | Nowhere (generated via Gemini, stored locally) | User edits freely |
| Entity data (NPCs, locations, etc.) | Local SQLite DB | Nowhere | User creates, edits, deletes |
| Entity images | Local file system | Nowhere | User picks, app resizes, user deletes |
| API keys (Gemini, Resend) | OS secure storage | Sent as auth headers to respective APIs | User enters and can clear |
| Email addresses (notification recipients) | Local SQLite DB | Resend API (for sending emails) | User configures in settings |

## Overview

TTRPG Session Tracker is a desktop application that stores all user data
locally on your computer. We do not operate servers that collect or store
your data.

## Data We Collect

We do not collect any personal data. The app does not have user accounts,
does not require registration, and does not transmit data to our servers.

## Data Stored on Your Device

All app data is stored locally on your computer:
- Audio recordings of your sessions
- Transcripts and AI-generated summaries
- Campaign data (NPCs, locations, items, etc.)
- App preferences and settings

This data never leaves your device except when explicitly sent to
third-party APIs as described below.

## Third-Party Services

The app communicates with the following third-party services when you
choose to use features that require them:

### Google Gemini API
- **What's sent:** Audio data (for transcription on Windows/Linux),
  transcript text (for AI processing)
- **When:** Only during active transcription or AI processing
- **Why:** To transcribe audio and generate session summaries
- **Their privacy policy:** https://policies.google.com/privacy
- **Your API key:** You provide your own API key. We never see or store
  it on our servers.

### Resend API
- **What's sent:** Email addresses and email content
- **When:** Only when you use the email notification feature
- **Why:** To send session summaries to specified recipients
- **Their privacy policy:** https://resend.com/legal/privacy-policy

## Data Retention

All data remains on your device until you delete it. The app does not
automatically delete audio recordings, transcripts, or any other data.

To delete all app data, remove the app's data directory:
- **macOS:** ~/Library/Application Support/com.gatewayadventure.ttrpgTracker/
- **Windows:** %APPDATA%\com.gatewayadventure\ttrpg_tracker\
- **Linux:** ~/.local/share/ttrpg_tracker/

## Analytics

[If using Aptabase:]
We collect anonymous usage statistics (app opens, feature usage counts)
using Aptabase, a privacy-friendly analytics service. No personal
information is collected. You can opt out in Settings → Privacy.

[If not using analytics:]
We do not collect any analytics or usage data.

## Children's Privacy

This app is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly
collect data from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted
on our website and noted in app release notes.

## Contact

For privacy questions, contact: [YOUR_EMAIL]

Host at `/terms` on your landing page.

### Terms of Service Template

```markdown
# Terms of Service

Last updated: [DATE]

## Acceptance

By using TTRPG Session Tracker, you agree to these terms.

## Description of Service

TTRPG Session Tracker is a desktop application for recording, transcribing,
and managing tabletop RPG sessions. The app uses AI services (Google Gemini)
for transcription and content generation.

## API Keys and Costs

- You must provide your own Google Gemini API key to use AI features.
- You are responsible for any costs incurred from your use of third-party
  APIs (Google Gemini, Resend).
- API usage is subject to the respective provider's terms of service and
  usage limits.

## AI-Generated Content

- Summaries, entity extractions, and podcast scripts are generated by AI
  and may contain errors or inaccuracies.
- You are responsible for reviewing and editing AI-generated content.
- AI-generated content should not be relied upon as authoritative or
  factual without review.

## Data and Backups

- All data is stored locally on your device.
- You are responsible for backing up your data.
- We are not liable for data loss due to hardware failure, software bugs,
  or any other cause.

## Disclaimer of Warranties

THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WE MAKE NO
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE APP.

## Changes to Terms

We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use
of the app constitutes acceptance of modified terms.

## Contact

For questions about these terms, contact: [YOUR_EMAIL]

## GDPR Considerations

Even though the app is offline-first and doesn't collect personal data on your servers, GDPR may apply if you have EU users and any data is sent to third-party services.

### 1. Data Sent to Google Gemini API

- Audio data and transcript text are sent to Google's servers for processing
- Google's Gemini API [data processing terms](https://ai.google.dev/terms) state that API data is not used to train models (verify current terms)
- This is a data processor relationship — Google processes data on behalf of the user
- Since the user provides their own API key, they have a direct relationship with Google

### 2. Audio Data Stays Local (macOS Whisper)

On macOS, transcription is done locally via Whisper — no data leaves the device. This is the most privacy-friendly option and has no GDPR implications.

### 3. Email via Resend

- When using the email feature, recipient email addresses and email content are sent to Resend
- Resend has its own Data Processing Agreement (DPA)
- Only triggered when the user explicitly sends an email

### 4. Data Export (Already Implemented)

The app already supports exporting all session data as Markdown, JSON, and CSV. This satisfies the GDPR "right to data portability" requirement.

### 5. Data Deletion

To satisfy "right to deletion":
- Users can delete individual sessions, entities, and campaigns within the app
- For complete deletion, users can remove the app's data directory (paths listed in privacy policy)
- Consider adding a "Delete all data" button in Settings for convenience

### 6. Consent

- AI processing requires explicit user action (pressing "Process" or recording a session)
- No background data collection
- Analytics (if added) should be opt-in or at minimum provide an opt-out toggle

## When to Consult a Lawyer

These templates are starting points. Consult a lawyer if:
- You plan to monetize the app (licensing, subscriptions)
- You process data through your own backend (Step 3 in [07-api-key-management.md](07-api-key-management.md))
- You distribute in the EU and want full GDPR compliance verification
- You add user accounts or authentication
- You handle payment processing
